## About

This repository contains code for our ACL19's paper [Argument Generation with Retrieval, Planning, and Realization](http://xinyuhua.github.io/resources/acl2019/acl2019.pdf). 

**Note**: part of this repository is under construction. The stable version is excepted to be released in September, 2019.

## Usage
### Requirement:

- python 3.5
- PyTorch 1.1.0
- numpy 1.14


### Data:

The dataset we used is currently held on Google drive, which can be accessed in this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fl9uxfkplJtbEppx4XeJ77nI0Iov_ZYL?usp=sharing).

### Pre-trained weights:

As described in the paper, we pre-train the encoder and realization decoder with extra data from changemyview. The pre-trained weights can be downloaded here: [encoder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17dRozwLlWN_FgWQOyj-4fbsJC07bVZVx); [decoder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KO4FfxIQ1A8xKcT8QpTM6q28ZvLT_1Cd)
